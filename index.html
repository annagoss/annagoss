<h1>Anna Goss</h1>

<p>I produce digital projects, with a focus on business transformation and service design. I do design thinking, facilitation, communication, transformation, user research, customer journey mapping, and business model generation. I can also use Git. It should go without saying that 'I do agile'.</p>

<p>I've worked with Soho House, Resonance FM, Barclays and Dot Everyone.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I chair the advisory board at London Bike Kitchen, a DIY repair workshop, and am taking a masters in Design, Strategy and Leadership at Cranfield University.</p>
